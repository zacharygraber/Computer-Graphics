Problem Set 02
Zachary Graber (zegraber)

1. I used my personal desktop computer running Unity 2020.3.16f1 LTS. All scripts are located in the Assets/Scripts folder, and include DragObject.cs, SplineParameters.cs, and SplineSegmentCPUCompute.cs. The only assets I used are the aforementioned scripts, and stock Unity ones, such as the Default-Line material, and UI elements.

2. I believe I completed everything that was outlined in the instructions.

3. I like the UI buttons for changing spline types, and I'm proud that they scale with resolution quite nicely :)
