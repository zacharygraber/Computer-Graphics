1. I have mostly just been using the STC lab computers so far (they have 2020.3.16f1), although my computer at home *does also have* the same version in case I need to use it

2. I completed the Introduction to Unity tutorial, as well as the "Moving the Player" tutorial on the Unity site. 

3. I added some camera control, by giving it [the camera] a script that updates its x and z coordinates to that of the player sphere every frame (essentially locking its y-coordinate but following the ball around), added some walls to prevent falling off the edge, and added some RigidBody cubes to push around and play with.

4. No questions here :)
